- ‚úÖ **No authentication required**: Perfect for trusted home networks  
- ‚úÖ **Persistent data**: Survives container restarts and updates
- ‚úÖ **Latest TiddlyWiki**: Always runs the most recent stable version
- ‚úÖ **Optional authentication**: Can be enabled for security
- ‚úÖ **Health monitoring**: Integrated with Home Assistant monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Multi-architecture**: Supports all Home Assistant platforms
